Simulator python script for motor controllers

This python script is used to simulate the motion controller on the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. It calculates a "tick-exact" simulation of the timer, to test the validity of motion control programs without having to run them on the actual machine.

As is, this is just a "work-in-progress" python script. However, at some point this piece of code will be integrated in the SPV-CAM software piece.
